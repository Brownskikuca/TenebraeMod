The Tenebrae Mod is a mod that aims to improve the overall Terraria experience by adding new weapons, items, and other bits of content / QoL changes.
We plan to add a lot more stuff in due time, including post-ML content (a new biome and gamemode), plus a full overhaul to the meteorite biome.
A lot of the coming changes will be focused around a theme of "cosmic horror".

This mod is currently W.I.P.
